# ChomBox-MIDI-Fighter-Code
Code for my MIDI controller made with an Arduino and arcade buttons.

This project utilizes all analog and digital pins on the Arduino Uno to send MIDI information to a computer for use in software such as Ableton Live or Logic. This data is sent via MIDI cable or serial USB (chip must be flashed or an external shield must be used to send MIDI via USB only) in the form of cc messages triggering events such as note on/off or assignable MIDI scale data. Everything was assembled by me, which included drilling the button/knob holes, soldering the perf board, and fastening all components to the enclosure.
